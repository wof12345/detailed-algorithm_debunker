    <h1>Bubble sort</h1>
    <p>
      Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an
      element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
      There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in
      different ways. Always pick first element as pivot. Always pick last
      element as pivot (implemented below) Pick a random element as pivot. Pick
      median as pivot. The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of
      partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at
      its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller
      than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x.
      All this should be done in linear time.
    </p>
    <h3>Code:</h3>

    <code>
      partition (arr[], low, high) { // pivot (Element to be placed at right
      position) pivot = arr[high]; i = (low - 1) // Index of smaller element and
      indicates the // right position of pivot found so far for (j = low; j <=
      high- 1; j++) { // If current element is smaller than the pivot if (arr[j]
      < pivot) { i++; // increment index of smaller element swap arr[i] and
      arr[j] } } swap arr[i + 1] and arr[high]) return (i + 1) }
    </code>
